# Hybrid Heat Transfer Calculator

The casing of a hybrid rocket engine should experience the most heat around the post-combustion chamber. This weakens the casing by lowering its ultimate tensile strength, potentially making it rupture.

This calculator determines the case temperature and the heat flow through it over the burn time of the rocket. Take the maximum temperature found, find the associated tensile/ultimate strength for the material, and run a structural FEA using the new tensile/ultimate strength to find a safety factor.
