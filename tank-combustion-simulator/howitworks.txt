In order to use this sweep simulator, you need to install the G++ compiler, and python3. Once you have these tools, you need to execute the program sweep_sim.py however you like, but so that you can input information (through a command line interface is a good option, but the python interpreter also works). You need to execute the program in the same directory where the file sweep_sim.py resides, otherwise weird errors may arise.

Once you execute it, it will ask you to provide some configuration options. E.g. the first question is to detail which variables you wish to sweep simulate, and you have to enter the numbers of the options (0,1,2,3,etc) by separating them with a comma. Then it will ask you for the parameters for the variables that will sweep simulate, and afterwards with the parameters of the fixed variables. Once you provide these, it will execute the simulation.o binary file, which is the actual simulation, and this program will create the resulting files in a directory (folder) "sweep_data". Here you will have the results in a sorted manner, where each subfolder is an instance of the simulation, with the configurations for that particular simulations in the file "config.txt"
