# Hybrid Engine Tank Emptying and Combustion Simulator

This is a collection of disconnected ideas. Eventually, we want to be able to simulate how self-pressurized nitrous oxide flows out of an oxidizer tank over time. At the same time, we'd like to calculate the pressure in the combustion chamber (approximately, because combustion is hard) using this data and, perhaps, a fuel grain regression simulation. This will, more or less, completely model the engine and give a complete calculated thrust curve, which would be really cool.

Josh Collins has put C++ code into a number of files here based on "Modelling the nitrous run tank emptying" from Aspire Space (see references folder).  

A few equations and references that may be helpful in making this a complete simulation are in "Performance characterization of complex fuel port geometries for hybrid rocket fuel grains".
